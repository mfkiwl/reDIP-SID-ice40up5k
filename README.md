# reDIP SID

## MOS 6581/8580 SID FPGA emulation platform
![Board](documentation/reDIP-SID-board.png)

## Overview
The reDIP SID is an open source hardware development board which combines the following in a DIP-28 size package:

* Lattice iCE40UP5K FPGA
* NXP SGTL5000 Audio Codec
* 128Mbit FLASH
* 64Mbit PSRAM
* User LED
* Push button
* USB-C receptacle for power and FPGA Full Speed USB
* 5V tolerant I/O

The reDIP SID is a leaner relative of the [reDIP SX](https://github.com/daglem/reDIP-SX),
more squarely focused on providing an open source hardware platform for MOS 6581/8580 SID emulation.

The reDIP SID also aims to be a good no-frills generic choice for FPGA projects which may find use for audio and/or 5V tolerant I/O.

## General use

### I/O interfaces

#### Header pins:

* 5V input
* 3.3V output
* 19 FPGA GPIO
* 3 FPGA current drive / open-drain I/O
* 3 audio pins (line input, stereo headphone output)
* GND

All FPGA I/O is 5V tolerant, and can drive 5V TTL. JP1 can be shorted to make the 5V input pin bidirectional, e.g. to power 5V TTL devices.

#### FPGA SPI / Programming:

A separate header footprint is provided for FPGA SPI / programming, with pinout borrowed from the [iCEBreaker Bitsy](https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker).

#### USB-C functions:

* 5V power
* FPGA Full Speed USB

## MOS 6581/8580 SID compatibility

The board is mostly pin compatible with the venerable MOS 6581/8580 SID sound chip.

For anyone wanting to experiment with a SID setup, while avoiding damaged sockets and release of magic smoke:

* Make sure that JP1 is open
* Remove pins 1 - 4 and 28 from a 28 pin stamped DIP socket, and use this as an adapter. Do not attempt to mount the board directly in a SID socket!

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is only my second board - rookie mistakes are probably made, and [feedback](https://github.com/daglem/reDIP-SID/discussions/2) is welcome. The board has not been manufactured yet, and is thus completely untested.
